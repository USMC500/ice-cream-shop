<!-- Layout -->

More time and thinking on it the picture I have down works great for a floor but I might be able to get away with making the counter area a container then maybe the roof as another? I think that could look great.

<!-- Design thoughts -->

Thinking about the design and considering I can make a background image of like a checkered black and white background for the body then I can make the tables and stuff around. I have also considered making it a "blue print" view like from the ceiling I think could be a interesting choice while using the animations to move people around or chairs.

<!-- Initial thoughts -->

I am currently thinking on my ice cream parlor and how I am going to do it. I am currently thinking about getting a 50's diner ice cream concept and maybe animating the ice cream scoop. I am not sure how I am going to di it but we will see.
