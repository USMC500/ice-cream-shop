<!-- thoughts -->

My current thoughts of adding one person maybe even two as emplyees and giving them a fun uniform to help make the image come to life while also adding a banner for them under the register to break up the repitivity of gray.

<!-- Menu -->

Considering the menu I wanted more of a "homey" feel so I got the hand written chalk feeling in order to create the illusion of it being more of a mom and pop shop.

<!-- Counter layout -->

I want to make a counter all the way accross the screen maybe with one or two workers on it with one "scooping icecream" or something like that. I can use simple shapes to make most of it and it could work quite well.

<!-- Layout -->

More time and thinking on it the picture I have down works great for a floor but I might be able to get away with making the counter area a container then maybe the roof as another? I think that could look great.

<!-- Design thoughts -->

Thinking about the design and considering I can make a background image of like a checkered black and white background for the body then I can make the tables and stuff around. I have also considered making it a "blue print" view like from the ceiling I think could be a interesting choice while using the animations to move people around or chairs.

<!-- Initial thoughts -->

I am currently thinking on my ice cream parlor and how I am going to do it. I am currently thinking about getting a 50's diner ice cream concept and maybe animating the ice cream scoop. I am not sure how I am going to di it but we will see.
